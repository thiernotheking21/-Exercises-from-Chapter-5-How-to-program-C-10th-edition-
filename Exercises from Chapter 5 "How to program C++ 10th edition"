/*
A mail order house sells five different products whose retail prices are:
product 1 — $2.98, product 2 — $4.50, product 3 — $9.98, product 4 — $4.49 and
product 5 — $6.87. Write a program that reads a series of pairs of numbers as 
follows:
a) product number
b) quantity sold
Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for
each product. Your program should calculate and display the total retail value
of all products sold. Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the
program should stop looping and display the final results.
